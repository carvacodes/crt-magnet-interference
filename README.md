# CRT Magnet Interference

A cubic Bezier curve experiment that started as a simulation of a kid, a magnet, and an old TV. Touch-drag or move the mouse to move the entire grid, or tap/click to place and remove four Bezier control points. If four points are already placed, click on the grid (not a point) to remove them all. Try adjusting the grid size up or down from the Settings menu, too!
